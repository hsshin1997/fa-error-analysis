# Error Analysis

## Overview

The **Error Analysis** project is designed to analyze error logs from various systems, including OHT (Overhead Hoist Transport), AGV (Automated Guided Vehicles), Conveyors, and Stacker Cranes. The project provides tools to analyze the logs and generate reports on error patterns, such as the top errors by total downtime and the most frequently occurring errors.
